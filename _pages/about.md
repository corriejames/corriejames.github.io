I am a second-year PhD student funded by the Hadamard Doctoral School of Mathematics at the Université de Paris-Saclay, and a member of the Laboratoire de Mathématiques de Versailles, the COMMEDIA team at Inria of Paris, and the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis-Lions at Sorbonne Université. I work on inverse problems and data assimilation for biomedical applications and enjoy the intersection of mathematical modeling, statistical learning, scientific computing, and statistics. My PhD is titled "The Interaction Between Data and Modelling for Biomedical Applications" and is supervised by [Muriel Boulakia](https://boulakia.perso.math.cnrs.fr) (Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and Université de Paris-Saclay) and [Damiano Lombardi](https://team.inria.fr/commedia/lombardi/) (Inria of Paris and Sorbonne Université). We study how the inclusion of population data in the resolution of inverse problems can improve results, both theoretically and numerically. In 2023, I completed the Master's "Mathématiques de la Modélisation" at Sorbonne Université.
